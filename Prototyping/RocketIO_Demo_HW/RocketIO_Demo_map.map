Number of warnings:    2
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   246 out of  44,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 246
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        215 out of  44,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      213 out of  44,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             161
      Number using O5 output only:              19
      Number using O5 and O6:                   33
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        21 out of  89,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                21

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   128 out of  11,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          338
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            92 out of     338   27%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 123 out of     338   36%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         123 out of     338   36%
    Number of unique control sets:              22
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              26 out of  44,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     18 out of   5,328    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
